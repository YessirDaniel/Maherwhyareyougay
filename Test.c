#include <stdio.h>
printf("hi");
//hi max what are u doing 
'''wait max how do i run the code
i dont think you can without local access
or you could copy paste onto codespace
whats local access
like a local ide
and we dont have local ide
:(
start a gofundme
alo
wait how do i even run the code i cant
exactly
wait how do i run regularly? 
you would need to get vscode
no like i right click on my file it says run python file in terminal
well usually you can just run in terminal but you could also do that too
wait how do u run in terminal i forgot
for python its just python followed by the file name and any command line args
for c i think you have to make and then ./filename
but when i do make test. it says no rule to make test.c STOp
HELLO U THERE?
i think u have to include stdio.h
I DONT THINK THAT MADE A DIFFERENCE
actually I think make is premade for cs50
you can search up how to compile it i think, im pretty sure I remember them referencing clang
wait i can run
or you can get an extention

gcc -o my_executable my_program.c
